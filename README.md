# Task Tracking App

### Welcome to my Task Tracking App using React!

<br />

With the help of [Brad Traversy's 2021 React Crash Course](https://github.com/bradtraversy/react-crash-2021) on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8), I wanted to deepen my understanding of React so I decided to use this project to build upon my current skills. As I'm learning how to use and integrate APIs, I thought I'd use the opportunity to practice with the recommended mock APIs on [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

In the future my intentions are to integrate UI/UX design, additional JS functionality, server side changes/updates, along with the use of new tools and languages.
